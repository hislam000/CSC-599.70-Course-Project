    Questions and Tasks
# (1) Data Usage.
(a) What outside data have you appended to the original data set? Why did you choose this data? 

- We decided to append apartment zip codes and income. We wanted to use the zip codes to see if income of tenants have anything to do with the rents at the areas. 

(b) Does the inclusion of this additional data raise any ethical considerations? 

# (2) Data Exploration. 
(a) What outliers present issues for your analysis? How have you chosen to handle them? Why?

(b) To what extent do missing values pose a challenge for your analysis? How have you chosen to handle them? Why?

(c) Are there any other aspects of the data your exploration shows might be problematic? 

(d) Create at least one visualization that demonstrates the predictive power of your data. 

# (3) Transformation and Modeling.
 (a) Describe 5-10 features you think play the biggest role in your model. 

• How did you create these features? 

• How do you know these features are playing key roles? 

(b) Describe how you are implementing your model. Why do you think this works well? 

(c) Describe your methodology for selecting your model. Why do you think this type of model works well? 

# (4) Metrics, Validation, and Evaluation. 
(a) How well do you think you model will perform on the hold out test set? How do you know? 3 

(b) Is your model useful? Why or why not? 

(c) Are there any special cases in which your model works particularly well or particularly poorly? 

(d) Create at least one visualization that demonstrates the predictive power of your model. 

# (5) Conclusion 
(a) How would you use this model? 

(b) If you could have additional modeling features, what would they be? 

(c) Would you rather have more data, or more features?
